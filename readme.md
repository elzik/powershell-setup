# Powershell Setup

This is a Powershell script I use to set up Powershell Core with my preferred modules and prompt theme. The modules installed are:
- [DockerMsftProvider](https://github.com/OneGet/MicrosoftDockerProvider)
- [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
- [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git)
- [SqlServer](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer)
- [PSReadline](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSReadLine) 
- [Terminal-Icons](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons)

In order for the themed prompt to display correctly you will need to install a font which includes programming ligatures. 'Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible.ttf' from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) is recommended. See [this guide](https://www.get-itsolutions.com/windows-terminal-change-font/) for then setting the font in Windows Terminal.
